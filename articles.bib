  abstract = {ECG databases are usually highly imbalanced due to the abundance of Normal ECG and scarcity of abnormal cases. As such, deep learning classifiers trained on imbalanced datasets usually perform poorly, especially on minor classes. One solution is to generate realistic synthetic ECG signals using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to augment imbalanced datasets. In this study, we combined conditional GAN with WGAN-GP and developed AC-WGAN-GP in 1D form for the first time to be applied on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. We investigated the impact of data augmentation on arrhythmia classification. We employed two models for ECG generation: (i) unconditional GAN; Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) is trained on each class individually; (ii) conditional GAN; one Auxiliary Classifier WGAN-GP (AC-WGAN-GP) model is trained on all classes and then used to generate synthetic beats in all classes. Two scenarios are defined for each case: (a) unscreened; all the generated synthetic beats were used, and (b) screened; only a portion of generated beats are selected and used, based on their Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance to a designated template. A state-of-the-art ResNet classifier (EcgResNet34) is trained on each of the augmented datasets and the performance metrics (precision/recall/F1-Score micro- and macro-averaged, confusion matrices, multiclass precision-recall curves) were compared with those of the unaugmented imbalanced case. We also used a simple metric Net Improvement. All the three metrics show consistently that net improvement (total and minor-class), unconditional GAN with raw generated data (not screened) creates the best improvements.},

  abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets tend to be highly imbalanced due to the scarcity of abnormal cases. Additionally, the use of real patients' ECGs is highly regulated due to privacy issues. Therefore, there is always a need for more ECG data, especially for the training of automatic diagnosis machine learning models, which perform better when trained on a balanced dataset. We studied the synthetic ECG generation capability of 5 different models from the generative adversarial network (GAN) family and compared their performances, the focus being only on Normal cardiac cycles. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Fr{\textbackslash}'echet, and Euclidean distance functions were employed to quantitatively measure performance. Five different methods for evaluating generated beats were proposed and applied. We also proposed 3 new concepts (threshold, accepted beat and productivity rate) and employed them along with the aforementioned methods as a systematic way for comparison between models. The results show that all the tested models can, to an extent, successfully mass-generate acceptable heartbeats with high similarity in morphological features, and potentially all of them can be used to augment imbalanced datasets. However, visual inspections of generated beats favors BiLSTM-DC GAN and WGAN, as they produce statistically more acceptable beats. Also, with regards to productivity rate, the Classic GAN is superior with a 72\% productivity rate. We also designed a simple experiment with the state-of-the-art classifier (ECGResNet34) to show empirically that the augmentation of the imbalanced dataset by synthetic ECG signals could improve the performance of classification significantly.},

  abstract = {Deep learning image processing models have had remarkable success in recent years in generating high quality images. Particularly, the Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) have shown superiority in image quality to the state-of-the-art generative models, which motivated us to investigate their capability in the generation of the synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. In this work, synthetic ECG signals are generated by the Improved DDPM and by the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) models and then compared. To this end, we devise a pipeline to utilize DDPM in its original \$2D\$ form. First, the \$1D\$ ECG time series data are embedded into the \$2D\$ space, for which we employed the Gramian Angular Summation/Difference Fields (GASF/GADF) as well as Markov Transition Fields (MTF) to generate three \$2D\$ matrices from each ECG time series, which when put together, form a \$3\$-channel \$2D\$ datum. Then \$2D\$ DDPM is used to generate \$2D\$ \$3\$-channel synthetic ECG images. The \$1D\$ ECG signals are created by de-embedding the \$2D\$ generated image files back into the \$1D\$ space. This work focuses on unconditional models and the generation of {\textbackslash}emph\{Normal Sinus Beat\} ECG signals exclusively, where the Normal Sinus Beat class from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset is used in the training phase. The {\textbackslash}emph\{quality\}, {\textbackslash}emph\{distribution\}, and the {\textbackslash}emph\{authenticity\} of the generated ECG signals by each model are quantitatively evaluated and compared. Our results show that in the proposed pipeline and in the particular setting of this paper, the WGAN-GP model is consistently superior to DDPM in all the considered metrics.},

Recently, diffusion models have set new standards for generative models for different data modalities. Also very recently, structured state space models emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm to capture long-term dependencies in time series. We put forward SSSD-ECG, as the combination of these two technologies, for the generation of synthetic 12-lead electrocardiograms conditioned on more than 70 ECG statements. Due to a lack of reliable baselines, we also propose conditional variants of two state-of-the-art unconditional generative models. We thoroughly evaluate the quality of the generated samples, by evaluating pretrained classifiers on the generated data and by evaluating the performance of a classifier trained only on synthetic data, where SSSD-ECG clearly outperforms its GAN-based competitors. We demonstrate the soundness of our approach through further experiments, including conditional class interpolation and a clinical Turing test demonstrating the high quality of the SSSD-ECG samples across a wide range of conditions.},

  abstract = {The first electrocardiogram (ECG) from the intact human heart was recorded with a mercury capillary electrometer by Augustus Waller in May 1887 at St. Mary's Hospital, London. The tracings were poor and exhibited only 2 distorted deflections. Willem Einthoven (1860-1927) who was professor of physiology at the University of Leiden, The Netherlands, began his studies of the ECG with the mercury capillary electrometer, and improved its distortion mathematically so that he was finally able to register a good representation of the ECG before the beginning of the twentieth century. He later further improved ECG recordings with the introduction of a string galvanometer of his design. Einthoven published his first article about the string galvanometer in 1901, followed by a more detailed description in 1903 which included a report of ECGs taken with the new instrument. The year 2002 marks the centennial of Willem Einthoven's first recording of the ECG in a clinically applicable fashion with the string galvanometer. The clinical use of Einthoven's immobile equipment required transtelephonic transmission of the ECG from the physiology laboratory to the clinic at the Academic Hospital about a mile away as documented in the 1906 paper on the "t{\'e}l{\'e}cardiogramme". This report contained a wealth of ECG patterns and arrhythmias. Einthoven developed a system of electrocardiographic standardization that continues to be used all over the world and introduced the triaxial bipolar system with 3 limb leads and thus established uniformity of the recording process. Einthoven also conceived the famous equilateral triangle with leads I, II, and III at its sides and the calculation of the electrical axis (in the frontal plane) depicted as a single vector with an arrow at the center of the triangle. Einthoven recognized the great potential importance of the ECG as a diagnostic and investigative tool and his achievements made him the founder of modern electrocardiography. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1924 (2 years after Waller's death) in physiology and medicine, "for the discovery of the mechanism of the electrocardiogram."},

W3ECG furthers the pad design idea of the single-pad approach. We add two more pads to the W3ECG to gain spatial variety of heart activity. Signals obtained from these three pads, plus their placement information, make it possible to synthesize conventional 12-lead ECG signals. We provide one example of pad placement and evaluate its performance by examining ECG data of four patients available from online database. Feasibility test of our selected pad placement positions show comparable results with respect to the EASI lead system. Experimental results also exhibit high correlations between synthesized and directly observed 12-lead signals (9 out of 12 cross-correlation coefficients higher than 0.75).},

As an upstream task, researches have built generative models to synthesize ECG data, which are beneficial to providing training samples, privacy protection, and annotation reduction. However, previous generative methods for ECG often neither synthesized multi-view data, nor dealt with heart disease conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel disease-aware generative adversarial network for multi-view ECG synthesis called ME-GAN, which attains panoptic electrocardio representations conditioned on heart diseases and projects the representations onto multiple standard views to yield ECG signals. Since ECG manifestations of heart diseases are often localized in specific waveforms, we propose a new "mixup normalization" to inject disease information precisely into suitable locations. In addition, we propose a view discriminator to revert disordered ECG views into a pre-determined order, supervising the generator to obtain ECG representing correct view characteristics. Besides, a new metric, rFID, is presented to assess the quality of the synthesized ECG signals. Comprehensive experiments verify that our ME-GAN performs well on multi-view ECG signal synthesis with trusty morbid manifestations.},

Based on input real patient records, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic patient records that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and a medical expert review. We also empirically observe a limited privacy risk in both identity and attribute disclosure using medGAN.},

  abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis is the area of research focused on generating realistic synthetic ECG signals for medical use without concerns over annotation costs or clinical data privacy restrictions. Traditional ECG generation models consider a single ECG lead and utilize GAN-based generative models. These models can only generate single lead samples and require separate training for each diagnosis class. The diagnosis classes of ECGs are insufficient to capture the intricate differences between ECGs depending on various features (e.g. patient demographic details, co-existing diagnosis classes, etc.). To alleviate these challenges, we present a text-to-ECG task, in which textual inputs are used to produce ECG outputs. Then we propose Auto-TTE, an autoregressive generative model conditioned on clinical text reports to synthesize 12-lead ECGs, for the first time to our knowledge. We compare the performance of our model with other representative models in text-to-speech and text-to-image. Experimental results show the superiority of our model in various quantitative evaluations and qualitative analysis.

  abstract = {We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for generating multi-channel ECG so that the simulation of abnormal rhythms is possible. Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG recordings. Abnormal beats are then specified either as new dipoles, or as perturbations of the existing dipole. Switching between normal and abnormal beat types is achieved using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Probability transitions can be learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal balance. Natural morphology changes form beat-to-beat are incorporated as before from varying the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat (RR) interval. The RR interval time series is generated using our previously described model whereby time-and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by coupling the Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a nonlinear factor related to the local HR (determined from the last n RR intervals). Morphology changes due to respiration are simulated by coupling the RR interval to the angular frequency of the dipole. We demonstrate an example of the use of this model by simulating T-Wave Alternans (TWA). The magnitude of the TWA effect is modeled as a disturbance on the T-loop of the dipole with a magnitude that differs in each of the three VCG planes. The effect is then turned on or off using a HMM. The values of the transition matrix are determined by the local heart rate, such that when the HR ramps up towards 100 BPM, the probability of observing a TWA effect rapidly but smoothly increases. In this way, no dasiasuddenpsila switching from non-TWA to TWA is observed, and the natural tendency for TWA to be associated with a critical HR-related activation level is simulated. Finally, to generate multi-lead signals, the VCG is mapped to any set of clinical leads using a Dower-like transform derived from a least-squares optimization between known VCGs and known lead morphologies. ECGs with calibrated amounts of TWA were generated by this model and included in the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2008 data set.},

  abstract = {A nonlinear model for generating lifelike humaia ECG, blood pressure and respiratory signals is described. Each cycle of the model corresponds to one heart beat and the signals therefore exhibit beat-to-beat fluctuations by driving the model with a sequence of RR intervals. By wing a modified version of entry no.201 of the CinC 2002 24-hour RR interval generator challenge. (such that the user can spec\& the probability of ectopy or artefact) and coupling it to three ordinary differential equations. the model generates a 24-hour ECG signal. Using both standard linear metrics, and nonlinear long range statistics, the signal is shown to exhibit many of the known characteristics such as Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia. Mayer waves and an overall diurnal rhythm. The RR interval time series is modelled as a set of stationary states (joined by a transient heart rate overshoot) of dcyering lengths, mean heart rates (HR),L F/HF ratios and standard deviations. The length of time in each state is governed by a power law distribution with marhd di- ferences between waking and sleep states. The statistics of each RR time series segment (a state) can be fully speced by its mean (HR) and spectral distribucion (LF/HF rario). The resultant ECG is shown to exhibit realistic QRSand Qrdispersions, R-S amplitude modulation and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia in the short term and normal values for nonlinear statistics (such as entropy) in the long term. By altering the porameters of the ECG model, introducing a heart-rate dependent delay (to simulate pulse transit time), and coupling the baseline to the long-term fluctuations of the 24 hour RR interval generatol; realistic short and long range blood pressure fluctuations are shown to result. Together with seeded RR interval dynamics, the morphology of the signals corn be fully specified by three parameters per feature and therefore a large range of drzerent (deteiministic) signals can be generated with fully known characteristics, to facilitate the tesfing of signal processing algorithms. Open source C, Matlab and Java programs for generating the model are available from Physionet.},

Machine learning based automated medical diagnostic systems that may help to evaluate the condition of the heart from this signal are required to be trained using large volumes of labelled training samples and the same may increase the chance of compromising with the patients' privacy. To solve this issue, generation of synthetic electrocardiogram signals by learning only from the general distributions of the available real training samples have been attempted in the literature. However, these studies did not pay necessary attention to the specific vital details of these signals, such as the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. This shortcoming often results in the generation of unrealistic synthetic signals, such as a signal which does not contain one or more of the above components. In the present study, a novel deep generative architecture, termed as CardioGAN, based on generative adversarial network and powered by the effective attention mechanism has been designed which is capable of learning the intricate inter-dependencies among the various parts of real samples leading to the generation of more realistic electrocardiogram signals. Also, it helps in reducing the risk of breaching the privacy of patients. Extensive experimentation performed by us establishes that the proposed method achieves a better performance in generating synthetic electrocardiogram signals in comparison to the existing methods.},

Common methods of de-identification implemented to enable the sharing of data are sometimes inadequate to protect the individuals contained in the data. For our research, we investigate the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic medical time series data which can be used without concerns over privacy. The aim is to generate synthetic ECG signals representative of normal ECG waveforms. GANs have been used successfully to generate good quality synthetic time series and have been shown to prevent re-identification of individual records. In this work, a range of GAN architectures are developed to generate synthetic sine waves and synthetic ECG. Two evaluation metrics are then used to quantitatively assess how suitable the synthetic data is for real world applications such as clinical training and data analysis. Finally, we discuss the privacy concerns associated with sharing synthetic data produced by GANs and test their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack. For the first time we both quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that GAN architecture can successfully generate time series signals that are not only structurally similar to the training sets but also diverse in nature across generated samples. We also report on their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack, protecting the privacy of the training set.},

  abstract = {Recent work in synthetic data generation in the time-series domain has focused on the use of Generative Adversarial Networks. We propose a novel architecture for synthetically generating time-series data with the use of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). The proposed architecture has several distinct properties: interpretability, ability to encode domain knowledge, and reduced training times. We evaluate data generation quality by similarity and predictability against four multivariate datasets. We experiment with varying sizes of training data to measure the impact of data availability on generation quality for our VAE method as well as several state-of-the-art data generation methods. Our results on similarity tests show that the VAE approach is able to accurately represent the temporal attributes of the original data. On next-step prediction tasks using generated data, the proposed VAE architecture consistently meets or exceeds performance of state-of-the-art data generation methods. While noise reduction may cause the generated data to deviate from original data, we demonstrate the resulting de-noised data can significantly improve performance for next-step prediction using generated data. Finally, the proposed architecture can incorporate domain-specific time-patterns such as polynomial trends and seasonalities to provide interpretable outputs. Such interpretability can be highly advantageous in applications requiring transparency of model outputs or where users desire to inject prior knowledge of time-series patterns into the generative model.},

WaveGAN is capable of synthesizing one second slices of audio waveforms with global coherence, suitable for sound effect generation. Our experiments demonstrate that, without labels, WaveGAN learns to produce intelligible words when trained on a small-vocabulary speech dataset, and can also synthesize audio from other domains such as drums, bird vocalizations, and piano. We compare WaveGAN to a method which applies GANs designed for image generation on image-like audio feature representations, finding both approaches to be promising.},

  abstract = {Background Privacy legislation in most jurisdictions allows the disclosure of health data for secondary purposes without patient consent if it is de-identified. Some recent articles in the medical, legal, and computer science literature have argued that de-identification methods do not provide sufficient protection because they are easy to reverse. Should this be the case, it would have significant and important implications on how health information is disclosed, including: (a) potentially limiting its availability for secondary purposes such as research, and (b) resulting in more identifiable health information being disclosed. Our objectives in this systematic review were to: (a) characterize known re-identification attacks on health data and contrast that to re-identification attacks on other kinds of data, (b) compute the overall proportion of records that have been correctly re-identified in these attacks, and (c) assess whether these demonstrate weaknesses in current de-identification methods. Methods and Findings Searches were conducted in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed. After screening, fourteen eligible articles representing distinct attacks were identified. On average, approximately a quarter of the records were re-identified across all studies (0.26 with 95\% CI 0.046--0.478) and 0.34 for attacks on health data (95\% CI 0--0.744). There was considerable uncertainty around the proportions as evidenced by the wide confidence intervals, and the mean proportion of records re-identified was sensitive to unpublished studies. Two of fourteen attacks were performed with data that was de-identified using existing standards. Only one of these attacks was on health data, which resulted in a success rate of 0.00013. Conclusions The current evidence shows a high re-identification rate but is dominated by small-scale studies on data that was not de-identified according to existing standards. This evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the efficacy of de-identification methods.},

In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from 'serialised' MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data.},

However, concerns have been raised by researchers about problems (biasing and misdiagnosis) associated with the ambiguous value and behavior of this reference voltage, which requires perfect and balanced contact of at least four electrodes to work properly. The Wilson Central Terminal has received scant research attention in the last few decades even though consideration of recent widespread medical practice (limb electrodes are repositioned closer to the torso for resting electrocardiography) has also sparkled concerns about the validity and diagnostic fitness of leads not referred to the Wilson Central Terminal. Using a true unipolar electrocardiography device capable of precisely measuring the Wilson Central Terminal, we show its unpredictable variability during the cardiac cycle and confirm that the integrity of cardinal leads is compromised as well as the Wilson Central Terminal when limb electrodes are placed close to the torso.},

Standard sequence modeling approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference even when using 3x fewer parameters.

Many attempts were made to automate this task using machine learning algorithms including classic supervised learning algorithms and deep neural networks, reaching state-of-the-art performance. The ECG signal conveys the specific electrical cardiac activity of each subject thus extreme variations are observed between patients. These variations are challenging for deep learning algorithms, and impede generalization. In this work, we propose a semisupervised approach for patient-specific ECG classification. We propose a generative model that learns to synthesize patient-specific ECG signals, which can then be used as additional training data to improve a patient-specific classifier performance.

We study the problem of heart signal electrocardiogram (ECG) synthesis for improved heartbeat classification. ECG synthesis is challenging: the generation of training examples for such biological-physiological systems is not straightforward, due to their dynamic nature in which the various parts of the system interact in complex ways. However, an understanding of these dynamics has been developed for years in the form of mathematical process simulators. We study how to incorporate this knowledge into the generative process by leveraging a biological simulator for the task of ECG classification. Specifically, we use a system of ordinary differential equations representing heart dynamics, and incorporate this ODE system into the optimization process of a generative adversarial network to create biologically plausible ECG training examples. We perform empirical evaluation and show that heart simulation knowledge during the generation process improves ECG classification.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence \$u {\textbackslash}mapsto y\$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation \${\textbackslash}dot\{x\} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du\$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices \$A\$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.},

  abstract = {A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of \$10000\$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) {\textbackslash}( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) {\textbackslash}), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation \$60{\textbackslash}times\$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.},

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3\%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40\% accuracy.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models over discrete data. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms.},

  abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\${\textbackslash}times\$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

However, due to constrained resources available in IoT devices, it is often difficult to accommodate training using large data sets. This paper proposes and demonstrates a Similarity Learning-based Few Shot Learning for ECG arrhythmia classification using Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks. Few shot learning resolves the data scarcity issue by identifying novel classes from very few labeled examples. Few Shot Learning relies first on pretraining the model on a related relatively large database, and then the learning is used for further adaptation towards few examples available per class. Our experiments evaluate the performance accuracy with respect to K (number of instances per class) for ECG time series data classification. The accuracy with 5- shot learning is 92.25\% which marginally improves with further increase in K. We also compare the performance of our method against other well-established similarity learning techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Euclidean Distance (ED), and a deep learning model - Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN) with the same amount of data and conclude that our method outperforms them for a limited dataset size. For K=5, the accuracies obtained are 57\%, 54\%, 33\%, and 92\% approximately for ED, DTW, LSTM-FCN, and SCNN, respectively.},

Deep generative models trained on protein sequence data have been shown to learn biologically meaningful representations helpful for a variety of downstream tasks, but their potential for direct use in the design of novel proteins remains largely unexplored. Here we show that variational autoencoders trained on a dataset of almost 70000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases can be used to generate novel, functional variants of the luxA bacterial luciferase. We propose separate VAE models to work with aligned sequence input (MSA VAE) and raw sequence input (AR-VAE), and offer evidence that while both are able to reproduce patterns of amino acid usage characteristic of the family, the MSA VAE is better able to capture long-distance dependencies reflecting the influence of 3D structure. To confirm the practical utility of the models, we used them to generate variants of luxA whose luminescence activity was validated experimentally. We further showed that conditional variants of both models could be used to increase the solubility of luxA without disrupting function. Altogether 6/12 of the variants generated using the unconditional AR-VAE and 9/11 generated using the unconditional MSA VAE retained measurable luminescence, together with all 23 of the less distant variants generated by conditional versions of the models; the most distant functional variant contained 35 differences relative to the nearest training set sequence. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep generative models to explore the space of possible protein sequences and generate useful variants, providing a method complementary to rational design and directed evolution approaches.},

For preventing the misuse of patient's private information, datasets are not always publicly available. There is a need to generate synthetic data that can be trained for the advancement of public healthcare without intruding on patient's confidentiality. Currently, rules for generating synthetic data are predefined and they require expert intervention, which limits the types and amount of synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial networks (GAN) model, named SynSigGAN, for automating the generation of any kind of synthetic biomedical signals. We have used bidirectional grid long short-term memory for the generator network and convolutional neural network for the discriminator network of the GAN model. Our model can be applied in order to create new biomedical synthetic signals while using a small size of the original signal dataset. We have experimented with our model for generating synthetic signals for four kinds of biomedical signals (electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), photoplethysmography (PPG)). The performance of our model is superior wheen compared to other traditional models and GAN models, as depicted by the evaluation metric. Synthetic biomedical signals generated by our approach have been tested while using other models that could classify each signal significantly with high accuracy.},

In this paper, we showcase how ECGradCAM attention maps can unmask how a novel deep learning model measures both amplitudes and intervals in 12-lead electrocardiograms, and we show an example of how attention maps may be used to develop novel ECG features.},

The QT interval is prolonged at night, but how the circadian rhythm and heart rate influence the dynamic QT measurements is still unsettled. The aims of the present study were: (1) to describe the reproducibility of beat-to-beat QT dynamics with respect to intrasubject, between-subject, and between-observer variability and (2) to describe the normal range, circadian variation, and heart rate dependence of QT dynamics.,  Methods: Ambulatory Holter recordings were performed three times on 20 healthy volunteers and were analyzed by two experienced cardiologists. Slope and intercept of the QT/RR regression, the variability of QT and R-R intervals expressed as the standard deviation, and the relation between QT and RR variability expressed as a variability ratio were measured among other QT dynamics.,  Results: The reproducibility of all QT dynamics was good. All QT dynamics showed circadian variation when calculated on an hourly basis. The day/night variation in slope could be explained by the differences in heart rate, whereas the day/night variation in intercept was heart rate independent.,  Conclusion: The present study shows that reliable automatic QT measurements could be performed, encouraging further evaluation of the clinical value of QT dynamics in risk stratification of cardiac patients.},

Recently, there has been a great attention towards accurate categorization of heartbeats. While there are many commonalities between different ECG conditions, the focus of most studies has been classifying a set of conditions on a dataset annotated for that task rather than learning and employing a transferable knowledge between different tasks. In this paper, we propose a method based on deep convolutional neural networks for the classification of heartbeats which is able to accurately classify five different arrhythmias in accordance with the AAMI EC57 standard. Furthermore, we suggest a method for transferring the knowledge acquired on this task to the myocardial infarction (MI) classification task. We evaluated the proposed method on PhysionNet's MIT-BIH and PTB Diagnostics datasets. According to the results, the suggested method is able to make predictions with the average accuracies of 93.4\% and 95.9\% on arrhythmia classification and MI classification, respectively.},

Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were studied. Each undenvent four ECG recordings, which were performed 1, 7, and 30 days apart. Two independent observers analyzed each ECG record. In each lead with a distinguishable T wave pattern, the RR interval, Q-peak of T interval, and Q-end of T interval were measured using a digitizing board with a 0.1-mm resolution. From each recording the following measures were derived: the maximum, minimum, and mean QT interval; maximum, minimum, and mean heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc); QT and QTc dispersion (the difference between the maximum and minimum QT interval among the 12 leads); and adjusted QT and QTc dispersion (dispersion divided by the square root of the number of leads measured). The interobserver and short-term (1 day) and long-term (1 week and 1 month) reproducibility of individual indices was assessed by computing the relative errors and comparing them by a standard sign test. In addition, the distributions of maximum and minimum QTc values among electrocardiographicleads, and the differences between QT-end and QT-peak based measurements were investigated. The results showed that: (1) the measurement of the QT interval from standard ECG recordings is feasible and not operator dependent (interobserver relative error {$<$}4\%); (2) the duration of the QT interval in healthy volunteers is stable and its short- and long-term reproducibility is high (intrasubject relative error {$<$} 6\%); (3) parameters that characterize dispersion of the QT interval in the 12-lead ECG are highly nonreproducible, both between subsequent recording (relative error of 25\%--35\%) and between observers (relative errar 28\%--33\%), the reproducibility of QT dispersion is significantly lower than that of QT duration (P {$<$} 0.01); and (4) the duration of the entire QT interval correlates only weakly with the duration of the Q-peak of T interval.},

  abstract = {Denoising diffusion models, a class of generative models, have garnered immense interest lately in various deep-learning problems. A diffusion probabilistic model defines a forward diffusion stage where the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise and then learns to reverse the diffusion process to retrieve the desired noise-free data from noisy data samples. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for their strong mode coverage and quality of the generated samples despite their known computational burdens. Capitalizing on the advances in computer vision, the field of medical imaging has also observed a growing interest in diffusion models. To help the researcher navigate this profusion, this survey intends to provide a comprehensive overview of diffusion models in the discipline of medical image analysis. Specifically, we introduce the solid theoretical foundation and fundamental concepts behind diffusion models and the three generic diffusion modelling frameworks: diffusion probabilistic models, noise-conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. Then, we provide a systematic taxonomy of diffusion models in the medical domain and propose a multi-perspective categorization based on their application, imaging modality, organ of interest, and algorithms. To this end, we cover extensive applications of diffusion models in the medical domain. Furthermore, we emphasize the practical use case of some selected approaches, and then we discuss the limitations of the diffusion models in the medical domain and propose several directions to fulfill the demands of this field. Finally, we gather the overviewed studies with their available open-source implementations at https://github.com/amirhossein-kz/Awesome-Diffusion-Models-in-Medical-Imaging.},

Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

  abstract = {Goal: This paper presents a fast and accurate patient-specific electrocardiogram (ECG) classification and monitoring system. Methods: An adaptive implementation of 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is inherently used to fuse the two major blocks of the ECG classification into a single learning body: feature extraction and classification. Therefore, for each patient, an individual and simple CNN will be trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and thus, such patient-specific feature extraction ability can further improve the classification performance. Since this also negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted manual features, once a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner or alternatively, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time ECG monitoring and early alert system on a light-weight wearable device. Results: The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a superior classification performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusion: Besides the speed and computational efficiency achieved, once a dedicated CNN is trained for an individual patient, it can solely be used to classify his/her long ECG records such as Holter registers in a fast and accurate manner. Significance: Due to its simple and parameter invariant nature, the proposed system is highly generic, and, thus, applicable to any ECG dataset.},

In this paper, we study two types of bad positive pairs that can impair the quality of time series representation learned through contrastive learning: the noisy positive pair and the faulty positive pair. We observe that, with the presence of noisy positive pairs, the model tends to simply learn the pattern of noise (Noisy Alignment). Meanwhile, when faulty positive pairs arise, the model wastes considerable amount of effort aligning non-representative patterns (Faulty Alignment). To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Bad Pair Mining (DBPM) algorithm, which reliably identifies and suppresses bad positive pairs in time series contrastive learning. Specifically, DBPM utilizes a memory module to dynamically track the training behavior of each positive pair along training process. This allows us to identify potential bad positive pairs at each epoch based on their historical training behaviors. The identified bad pairs are subsequently down-weighted through a transformation module, thereby mitigating their negative impact on the representation learning process. DBPM is a simple algorithm designed as a lightweight plug-in without learnable parameters to enhance the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods. Through extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale, real-world time series datasets, we demonstrate DBPM's efficacy in mitigating the adverse effects of bad positive pairs.},

  abstract = {Learning information-rich and generalizable representations effectively from unlabeled multivariate cardiac signals to identify abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias) is valuable in real-world clinical settings but often challenging due to its complex temporal dynamics. Cardiac arrhythmias can vary significantly in temporal patterns even for the same patient (\$i.e.\$, intra subject difference). Meanwhile, the same type of cardiac arrhythmia can show different temporal patterns among different patients due to different cardiac structures (\$i.e.\$, inter subject difference). In this paper, we address the challenges by proposing an Intra-inter Subject self-supervised Learning (ISL) model that is customized for multivariate cardiac signals. Our proposed ISL model integrates medical knowledge into self-supervision to effectively learn from intra-inter subject differences. In intra subject self-supervision, ISL model first extracts heartbeat-level features from each subject using a channel-wise attentional CNN-RNN encoder. Then a stationarity test module is employed to capture the temporal dependencies between heartbeats. In inter subject self-supervision, we design a set of data augmentations according to the clinical characteristics of cardiac signals and perform contrastive learning among subjects to learn distinctive representations for various types of patients. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets were conducted. In a semi-supervised transfer learning scenario, our pre-trained ISL model leads about 10\% improvement over supervised training when only 1\% labeled data is available, suggesting strong generalizability and robustness of the model.},

We cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we jointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator---analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test--- to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. The outputs from the discriminator are then used as rewards for the generative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemble human dialogues. In addition to adversarial training we describe a model for adversarial \{{\textbackslash}em evaluation\} that uses success in fooling an adversary as a dialogue evaluation metric, while avoiding a number of potential pitfalls. Experimental results on several metrics, including adversarial evaluation, demonstrate that the adversarially-trained system generates higher-quality responses than previous baselines.},

One of the main contributions of this paper is to reveal a unified geometric structure in GAN and its variants. Specifically, we show that the adversarial generative model training can be decomposed into three geometric steps: separating hyperplane search, discriminator parameter update away from the separating hyperplane, and the generator update along the normal vector direction of the separating hyperplane. This geometric intuition reveals the limitations of the existing approaches and leads us to propose a new formulation called geometric GAN using SVM separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometric GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium between the discriminator and generator. In addition, extensive numerical results show that the superior performance of geometric GAN.},

However, such datasets are often small, making the training of deep neural network architectures ineffective. For time-series, the suite of data augmentation tricks we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool. RNN-based GANs suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model long sequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle these problems, we introduce TTS-GAN, a transformer-based GAN which can successfully generate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length, similar to the real ones. Both the generator and discriminator networks of the GAN model are built using a pure transformer encoder architecture. We use visualizations and dimensionality reduction techniques to demonstrate the similarity of real and generated time-series data. We also compare the quality of our generated data with the best existing alternative, which is an RNN-based time-series GAN.},

Thus, every cardiologist and physician/cardiologist should be able to understand and interpret the 12-lead ECG.

Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data. Our code is available at https://github.com/bakqui/ST-MEM.},

Information provided from the signal based on the intervals and amplitudes of these waves is associated with various heart diseases. The first step in isolating the features of an ECG begins with the accurate detection of the R-peaks in the QRS complex. The database was based on the PTB-XL database, and the signals from Lead I--XII were analyzed. This research focuses on determining the Few-Shot Learning (FSL) applicability for ECG signal proximity-based classification. The study was conducted by training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize 2, 5, and 20 different heart disease classes. The results of the FSL network were compared with the evaluation score of the neural network performing softmax-based classification. The neural network proposed for this task interprets a set of QRS complexes extracted from ECG signals. The FSL network proved to have higher accuracy in classifying healthy/sick patients ranging from 93.2\% to 89.2\% than the softmax-based classification network, which achieved 90.5--89.2\% accuracy. The proposed network also achieved better results in classifying five different disease classes than softmax-based counterparts with an accuracy of 80.2--77.9\% as opposed to 77.1\% to 75.1\%. In addition, the method of R-peaks labeling and QRS complexes extraction has been implemented. This procedure converts a 12-lead signal into a set of R waves by using the detection algorithms and the k-mean algorithm.},

  abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classification. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is now one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a reliable tool for monitoring the health of the cardiovascular system. Currently, there has been a lot of focus on accurately categorizing heartbeats. There is a high demand for automatic ECG classification systems to assist medical professionals. But there is a big issue in obtaining original data extensively in medical domains in rare diseases, so it is essential to have a robust solution adopting this challenge. So, we need a solution that can address the problem of tackling data insufficiency, which is a major concern nowadays for medical applications. Without having, significant training samples the overall output can be demised. But the recent works on ECG classification did not address the challenge of solving the data insufficiency label problem. To overcome this issue, we developed a new generative adversarial network-based deep learning method called HeartNet for tackling the data insufficiency problem. The proposed deep learning method is compressed by a multi-head attention mechanism on CNN architecture. The main challenge of insufficient data labels is solved by adversarial data synthesis by adopting a generative adversarial network (GAN) with generating additional training samples. It drastically improves the overall performance of the proposed method by 5-10\% on each insufficient data label category. Since the training samples are increased. We evaluated our proposed method utilizing the MIT-BIH dataset. Our proposed method has shown 99.67{\textbackslash}pm 0.11 accuracy and 89.24{\textpm} 1.71 MCC trained with adversarial data synthesized dataset. However, we have also utilized two individual datasets as Atrial Fibrillation Detection Database and PTB Diagnostic Database to see the performance and generalization of our proposed model on ECG classification. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are validated by extensive experiments, comparison, and analysis. Later on, we also highlighted some limitations of this work.},

Here, we develop ProteinGAN, a self-attention-based variant of the generative adversarial network that is able to `learn' natural protein sequence diversity and enables the generation of functional protein sequences. ProteinGAN learns the evolutionary relationships of protein sequences directly from the complex multidimensional amino-acid sequence space and creates new, highly diverse sequence variants with natural-like physical properties. Using malate dehydrogenase (MDH) as a template enzyme, we show that 24\% (13 out of 55 tested) of the ProteinGAN-generated and experimentally tested sequences are soluble and display MDH catalytic activity in the tested conditions in vitro, including a highly mutated variant of 106 amino-acid substitutions. ProteinGAN therefore demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to rapidly generate highly diverse functional proteins within the allowed biological constraints of the sequence space.},

We demonstrate the ability of the model to adjust to age, sex and Body Mass Index (BMI) values. Our model is the first to incorporate imaging information by including heart position and orientation as input conditions, to analyse anatomical influences on generated ECG morphology. The network shows high accuracy and sensitivity to different conditions.

It is shown that this model may be effectively used for generating synthetic ECGs as well as separate characteristic waves (CWs) such as the atrial and ventricular complexes. The model uses separate state variables for each CW, i.e. P, QRS and T, and hence is capable of generating individual synthetic CWs as well as realistic ECG signals. The model is therefore useful for generating arrhythmias. Simulations of sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, ventricular flutter, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia are presented. In addition, discrete versions of the equations are presented for a model-based Bayesian framework for denoising. This framework, together with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and extended Kalman smoother (EKS), were used for denoising the ECG for both normal rhythms and arrhythmias. For evaluating the denoising performance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of the filter outputs and clinical parameter stability were studied. The results demonstrate superiority over a wide range of input SNRs, achieving a maximum 12.7 dB improvement. Results indicate that preventing clinically relevant distortion of the ECG is sensitive to the number of model parameters. Models are presented which do not exhibit such distortions. The approach presented in this paper may therefore serve as an effective framework for synthetic ECG generation and model-based filtering of noisy ECG recordings.},

In particular, the similarity measure is the most essential ingredient of time series clustering and classification systems. Because of this importance, countless approaches to estimate time series similarity have been proposed. However, there is a lack of comparative studies using empirical, rigorous, quantitative, and large-scale assessment strategies. In this article, we provide an extensive evaluation of similarity measures for time series classification following the aforementioned principles. We consider 7 different measures coming from alternative measure `families', and 45 publicly-available time series data sets coming from a wide variety of scientific domains. We focus on out-of-sample classification accuracy, but in-sample accuracies and parameter choices are also discussed. Our work is based on rigorous evaluation methodologies and includes the use of powerful statistical significance tests to derive meaningful conclusions. The obtained results show the equivalence, in terms of accuracy, of a number of measures, but with one single candidate outperforming the rest. Such findings, together with the followed methodology, invite researchers on the field to adopt a more consistent evaluation criteria and a more informed decision regarding the baseline measures to which new developments should be compared.},

  abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\textasciitilde}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({$<$}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\textasciitilde}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator's output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.},

D2C uses a learned diffusion-based prior over the latent representations to improve generation and contrastive self-supervised learning to improve representation quality. D2C can adapt to novel generation tasks, conditioned on labels or manipulation constraints, by learning from as few as 100 labeled examples. On conditional generation from new labels, D2C achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art VAEs and diffusion models. On conditional image manipulation, D2C generations are two orders of magnitude faster to produce over StyleGAN2 ones and are preferred by 50\% - 60\% of the human evaluators in a double-blind study.

  abstract = {This paper systematically investigates the effectiveness of various augmentations for contrastive self-supervised learning of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and identifies the best parameters. The baseline of our proposed self-supervised framework consists of two main parts: the contrastive learning and the downstream task. In the first stage, we train an encoder using a number of augmentations to extract generalizable ECG signal representations. We then freeze the encoder and finetune a few linear layers with different amounts of labelled data for downstream arrhythmia detection. We then experiment with various augmentations techniques and explore a range of parameters. Our experiments are done on PTB-XL, a large and publicly available 12-lead ECG dataset. The results show that applying augmentations in a specific range of complexities works better for self-supervised contrastive learning. For instance, when adding Gaussian noise, a sigma in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 achieves better results, while poor training occurs when the added noise is too small or too large (outside of the specified range). A similar trend is observed with other augmentations, demonstrating the importance of selecting the optimum level of difficulty for the added augmentations, as augmentations that are too simple will not result in effective training, while augmentations that are too difficult will also prevent the model from effective learning of generalized representations. Our work can influence future research on self-supervised contrastive learning on bio-signals and aid in selecting optimum parameters for different augmentations.},

Because gradients can be ill-defined and hard to estimate when the data resides on low-dimensional manifolds, we perturb the data with different levels of Gaussian noise, and jointly estimate the corresponding scores, i.e., the vector fields of gradients of the perturbed data distribution for all noise levels. For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples comparable to GANs on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on CIFAR-10.

The scarcity of labeled ECG data coupled with the diverse nature of clinical inquiries presents a significant challenge for developing robust and adaptable ECG diagnostic systems. This work introduces a novel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich knowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic approach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen LLM (e.g., LLaMA and Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language model to reason about ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks compared to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with limited ECG leads. For instance, in a 5-way 5-shot setting, our method using LLaMA-3.1-8B achieves accuracy of 84.6\%, 77.3\%, and 69.6\% on single verify, choose and query question types, respectively. These results highlight the potential of our method to enhance clinical ECG interpretation by combining signal processing with the nuanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, particularly in data-constrained scenarios.},

But privacy issues constitute a prevalent problem for collecting and sharing data between researchers. However, synthetic data generated to represent real data carrying similar information and distribution may alleviate the privacy issue. In this study, we present generative adversarial networks (GANs) capable of generating realistic synthetic DeepFake 10-s 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We have developed and compared two methods, named WaveGAN* and Pulse2Pulse. We trained the GANs with 7,233 real normal ECGs to produce 121,977 DeepFake normal ECGs. By verifying the ECGs using a commercial ECG interpretation program (MUSE 12SL, GE Healthcare), we demonstrate that the Pulse2Pulse GAN was superior to the WaveGAN* to produce realistic ECGs. ECG intervals and amplitudes were similar between the DeepFake and real ECGs. Although these synthetic ECGs mimic the dataset used for creation, the ECGs are not linked to any individuals and may thus be used freely. The synthetic dataset will be available as open access for researchers at OSF.io and the DeepFake generator available at the Python Package Index (PyPI) for generating synthetic ECGs. In conclusion, we were able to generate realistic synthetic ECGs using generative adversarial neural networks on normal ECGs from two population studies, thereby addressing the relevant privacy issues in medical datasets.},

Despite the easy access and affordability of ECG sensors, a critical bottleneck remains the limited availability of reliable data for complex heart rhythms like second and third-degree atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia. This shortage has been a significant obstacle to improving DNN algorithms. Recent studies have turned to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic ECG data, enhancing the diversity of training datasets. However, much of this research has only managed to produce basic ECG components, missing the intricate details found in real patient data that includes multiple heartbeats. Our research has taken a groundbreaking approach by converting ECG signals into a two-dimensional format, allowing us to utilize advanced GAN models originally developed for image processing. This method has enabled us to generate extended, realistic ECG sequences closely mimicking those from actual patients. We have tested and refined our model using two databases, Physionet and Chapman, and have successfully produced 10-second ECG sequences showcasing a variety of heart rhythms previously unachieved in other studies. Our innovative technique not only surpasses existing methods in generating high-quality, realistic ECG data but also sets a new benchmark in ECG synthesis.},

Automatic ECG interpretation algorithms as diagnosis support systems promise large reliefs for the medical personnel - only on the basis of the number of ECGs that are routinely taken.

In our opinion, both aspects are not covered satisfactorily by existing freely accessible ECG datasets. The PTB-XL ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21799 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18869 patients of 10 second length. The raw waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists, who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each record. The in total 71 different ECG statements conform to the SCP-ECG standard and cover diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements. To ensure comparability of machine learning algorithms trained on the dataset, we provide recommended splits into training and test sets. In combination with the extensive annotation, this turns the dataset into a rich resource for the training and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms. The dataset is complemented by extensive metadata on demographics, infarction characteristics, likelihoods for diagnostic ECG statements as well as annotated signal properties.},

Different techniques are used not only for measurement and interpretation, but also for transmission and storage of data. In order to fill these gaps, a large international project, sponsored by the European Commission, was launched in 1980 to develop "Common Standards for Quantitative Electrocardiography (CSE)". The main objective of the first CSE study was to reduce the wide variation in wave measurements currently obtained by ECG computer programs. The second study was started in 1985 and aimed at the assessment and improvement of diagnostic classification of ECG interpretation programs. To this end reference libraries of well documented ECGs have been developed and comprehensive reviewing schemes devised for the visual and computer analysis of ECGs. This task was performed by a board of cardiologists in a Delphi review process, and by 9 VCG and 10 standard 12-lead programs developed by university research groups and by industry. A third action was started in June 1989 to harmonize acquisition, encoding, interchange and storing of digital ECG data. The action thus performed have become internationally recognized milestones for the standardization of quantitative electrocardiography.},

The WaveNet-based model adopts {$\mu$}-law companding transformation as a preprocessing method and then is followed by a sequence of convolutional layers with dilation; SpectroGAN and WaveletGAN use shortterm Fourier transform (STFT) and stationary wavelet transform (SWT) respectively to obtain suitable input form for the generative adversarial networks (GAN). Our proposed models are capable of generating ECG signals containing three different heartbeat types: normal beat, left bundle branch block beat and right bundle branch block beat. The synthetic ECG signals generated by our models are more realistic since deep artificial neural networks can discover intricate structure and characteristics of real ECG signals instead of manually setting specific parameters for synthesis. Besides, ECG signals produced by one of our proposed models could be naturally continuous and be up to more than 20 seconds. Furthermore, we first provide an evaluation approach for quantitatively demonstrating the performance of ECG generative models. The study demonstrates that deep learning is a feasible and effective method for ECG generation.

In recent years, generative models have achieved great success in image and natural language synthesis. However, for ECG synthesis, the method is still in its infancy. So far, researchers in this field mainly focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) or its variants. Besides, the model generally produces data separately for different classes. This strategy leads to a cumbersome generative process and bias to classes with few instances. We propose two unique ECG generators to address the above problems: Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) and Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (CWGAN), which haven't been covered in previous works. We build simple networks for the encoder and decoder to demonstrate the strong potential of VAE for ECG synthesis. Additionally, we extend GANbased ECG generators to a more practical version by conditioning the generative process. We use the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database for performance evaluation. The results show that the conditional generative framework can shorten the training time and simplify the generation process without significant performance loss for ECG generators. In particular, the VAE-based ECG generator shows similar potential to the GAN-based model.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of deep generative models has been developed in the past decade. Yet, these models often struggle with simultaneously addressing three key requirements including: high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast sampling. We call the challenge imposed by these requirements the generative learning trilemma, as the existing models often trade some of them for others. Particularly, denoising diffusion models have shown impressive sample quality and diversity, but their expensive sampling does not yet allow them to be applied in many real-world applications. In this paper, we argue that slow sampling in these models is fundamentally attributed to the Gaussian assumption in the denoising step which is justified only for small step sizes. To enable denoising with large steps, and hence, to reduce the total number of denoising steps, we propose to model the denoising distribution using a complex multimodal distribution. We introduce denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks (denoising diffusion GANs) that model each denoising step using a multimodal conditional GAN. Through extensive evaluations, we show that denoising diffusion GANs obtain sample quality and diversity competitive with original diffusion models while being 2000\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared to traditional GANs, our model exhibits better mode coverage and sample diversity. To the best of our knowledge, denoising diffusion GAN is the first model that reduces sampling cost in diffusion models to an extent that allows them to be applied to real-world applications inexpensively.

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.},

In this work, we introduce GradInversion, using which input images from a larger batch (8 - 48 images) can also be recovered for large networks such as ResNets (50 layers), on complex datasets such as ImageNet (1000 classes, 224x224 px). We formulate an optimization task that converts random noise into natural images, matching gradients while regularizing image fidelity. We also propose an algorithm for target class label recovery given gradients. We further propose a group consistency regularization framework, where multiple agents starting from different random seeds work together to find an enhanced reconstruction of original data batch. We show that gradients encode a surprisingly large amount of information, such that all the individual images can be recovered with high fidelity via GradInversion, even for complex datasets, deep networks, and large batch sizes.},

  abstract = {A good generative model for time-series data should preserve temporal dynamics, in the sense that new sequences respect the original relationships between variables across time. Existing methods that bring generative adversarial networks (GANs) into the sequential setting do not adequately attend to the temporal correlations unique to time-series data. At the same time, supervised models for sequence prediction - which allow finer control over network dynamics - are inherently deterministic. We propose a novel framework for generating realistic time-series data that combines the flexibility of the unsupervised paradigm with the control afforded by supervised training. Through a learned embedding space jointly optimized with both supervised and adversarial objectives, we encourage the network to adhere to the dynamics of the training data during sampling. Empirically, we evaluate the ability of our method to generate realistic samples using a variety of real and synthetic time-series datasets. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that the proposed framework consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and predictive ability.},

  abstract = {As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major global health concern, causing significant morbidity and mortality. AI's integration with healthcare offers promising solutions, with data-driven techniques, including ECG analysis, emerging as powerful tools. However, privacy concerns pose a major barrier to distributing healthcare data for addressing data-driven CVD classification. To address confidentiality issues related to sensitive health data distribution, we propose leveraging artificially synthesized data generation. Our contribution introduces a novel diffusion-based model coupled with a State Space Augmented Transformer. This synthesizes conditional 12-lead electrocardiograms based on the 12 multilabeled heart rhythm classes of the PTB-XL dataset, with each lead depicting the heart's electrical activity from different viewpoints. Recent advances establish diffusion models as groundbreaking generative tools, while the State Space Augmented Transformer captures long-term dependencies in time series data. The quality of generated samples was assessed using metrics like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). To evaluate authenticity, we assessed the similarity of performance of a pre-trained classifier on both generated and real ECG samples.},

In particular, synthetic ECG signals can be beneficial for understanding cardiac electrical activity, developing large and heterogeneous unbiased datasets, and anonymizing data to favour knowledge sharing and open science. In the present scoping review, various methodologies to generate synthetic ECG data have been thoroughly analysed, highlighting their limitations and possibilities. A total of 79 studies have been included and classified, depending on the methodology employed, the number of leads, the number of heartbeats, and the purpose of data synthesis. Three main categories have been identified: mathematical modelling, computer vision inherited methods, and deep generative models. This thorough analysis can assist in the choice of the most suitable technique for a specific application. The biggest challenge is identifying standardized metrics that can comprehensively and quantitatively assess the fidelity and variability of generated synthetic ECG data.},

It uses a fully automatic end-to-end process to generate and verify the synthetic ECGs that does not require any visual inspection. The proposed model is able to produce synthetic standard 12-lead ECG signals with success rates of 98\% for LVH, 93\% for LBBB, 79\% for ACUTMI, and 59\% for Normal. Statistical evaluation of the data confirms that the synthetic ECGs are not biased towards or overfitted to the training ECGs, and span a wide range of morphological features. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to use a 2D GAN to produce standard 12-lead ECGs suitable to augment artificially a diverse database of real ECGs, thus providing a possible solution to the demand for extensive ECG datasets.},

Certain types of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, have a pronounced negative impact on public health, quality of life, and medical expenditures. As a non-invasive test, long term ECG monitoring is a major and vital diagnostic tool for detecting these conditions. This practice, however, generates large amounts of data, the analysis of which requires considerable time and effort by human experts. Advancement of modern machine learning and statistical tools can be trained on high quality, large data to achieve exceptional levels of automated diagnostic accuracy. Thus, we collected and disseminated this novel database that contains 12-lead ECGs of 10,646 patients with a 500\,Hz sampling rate that features 11 common rhythms and 67 additional cardiovascular conditions, all labeled by professional experts. The dataset consists of 10-second, 12-dimension ECGs and labels for rhythms and other conditions for each subject. The dataset can be used to design, compare, and fine-tune new and classical statistical and machine learning techniques in studies focused on arrhythmia and other cardiovascular conditions.},

However, automated medical-aided diagnosis with computers usually requires a large volume of labeled clinical data without patients' privacy to train the model, which is an empirical problem that still needs to be solved. To address this problem, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), which is composed of a bidirectional long short-term memory(LSTM) and convolutional neural network(CNN), referred as BiLSTM-CNN,to generate synthetic ECG data that agree with existing clinical data so that the features of patients with heart disease can be retained. The model includes a generator and a discriminator, where the generator employs the two layers of the BiLSTM networks and the discriminator is based on convolutional neural networks. The 48 ECG records from individuals of the MIT-BIH database were used to train the model. We compared the performance of our model with two other generative models, the recurrent neural network autoencoder(RNN-AE) and the recurrent neural network variational autoencoder (RNN-VAE). The results showed that the loss function of our model converged to zero the fastest. We also evaluated the loss of the discriminator of GANs with different combinations of generator and discriminator. The results indicated that BiLSTM-CNN GAN could generate ECG data with high morphological similarity to real ECG recordings.},

  abstract = {Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for \${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}textbf\{S\}\}\$tate s\${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}textbf\{P\}\}\$ace \${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}textbf\{A\}\}\$ugmente\${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}textbf\{D\}\}\$ Transform\${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}textbf\{E\}\}\$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.},
